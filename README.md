# Replication

I had some trouble with memory management in R, so I offloaded everything to Stata.
Eventually, I realized that my R code worked for subsetting/cleaning the datasets.
so I just left that R code in as a way to manage and then plot my results,
but did the regressions and more final data export in Stata.

The rcode folder has my R code, and the fig5.do file has all my 
Stata code. If you're reading this, then hopefully I changed the name of that final
and just forgot to update here.
